Spacebrew installation

#1
Copy the `spacebrew` folder from this folder to your `Processing/libraries`.

#2
If your Processing is running, quit and relaunch.

#3
You can browse Spacebrew examples on `File/Examples` and scrolling
down to `Contributer Libraries/Spacebrew` or just open the `sketch_01_bang`

#4
If you run Spacebrew examples from `File/Examples`, the administration page is:
`http://spacebrew.github.io/spacebrew/admin/admin.html?server=sandbox.spacebrew.cc`
Else if you open the sketches from our class, the administration page is:
`http://spacebrew.github.io/spacebrew/admin/admin.html?server=spacebrew.herokuapp.com&port=80`
