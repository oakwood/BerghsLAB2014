#Program Material
##Day 1
*Introduction to Processing, MakeyMakey and Arduino*
###01 - Hello Rectangle
Our very fist processign sketch that draw's a rectangle on the screen.
###02 - Drawing
Different drawing commands.
###03 - Inputs
How to detect mouse and keyboard interactions.
###04 - Image
How import and dsiplay images inside your sketch.
###05 - Sounds, Yeah!
How to import an audio file and playback it back when a key is pressed on the keyboard.
